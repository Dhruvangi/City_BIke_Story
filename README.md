- By what percentage has total ridership grown?
- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
- How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
- How does the average trip duration change by age?
- What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
- Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
